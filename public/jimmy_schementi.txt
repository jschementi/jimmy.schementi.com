Program Manager (7/2007 - Present)

  Project manager and software developer for open-source programming languages
  and tools, specifically IronRuby, IronPython, and the Dynamic Language 
  Runtime (DLR). Oversee the following areas:
  
  - `IronRuby <http://ironruby.net>`_, which involves release management, 
    specification and documentation writing, evangelism through blogs, public 
    appearances, and various social media, and development/compiler work where
    needed. `IronRuby 1.0 <http://ironruby.codeplex.com/releases/view/25901>`_
    shipped in April 2010.
  
  - `DLR Hosts <http://github.com/jschementi/ironruby/tree/master/Hosts>`_,
    which integrate DLR-languages with special application-models. I owned
    the spec-writing, coding, and testing of each project. See "Open Source
    Projects" section for more info.
  
  - Process streamlining - make sure this small team in a huge company has the
    tinyiest process overhead as possible. Communicated with lawyers and
    management about what could be streamlined, and implemented the changes --
    instead of weeks of reviews it's boiled down to 1 meeting and a couple emails.
  
  - `Lang.NET <http://langnetsymposium.com>`_, a 3-day conference of
    programming language and developer tool developers.
    
  - Websites - designed and built the main websites
    for both `IronRuby <http://ironruby.net>`_ and `IronPython <http://ironpython.net>`_.

Assistment.org Lead Developer (1-6/2007)

  Everything was re-thought, from the user-interface designed to the
  software that ran the system; originally written in Java it was
  rewritten using `Ruby on Rails <http://rubyonrails.org>`_. Not only was the
  system easier to manage and maintain, it also had more-complete features
  than the original. The system was gradually rolled out to schools, and it is
  still in use today.

Open-source projects
--------------------

`IronRuby <http://ironruby.net>`_
  Implementation of the Ruby programming language for .NET-based runtimes.

`IronPython <http://ironpython.net>`_
  Implementation of the Python programming language for .NET-based runtimes.

`Gestalt <http://ironpython.net/browser/>`_
  Enables Python and Ruby developers to run their language in the browser though
  Silverlight. This is a crutial feature when it comes to differentating the Iron*
  implementations from others.

`ironruby-rack <http://github.com/jschementi/ironruby/tree/master/Hosts/IronRuby.Rack/>`_

  of entry for both Windows shops looking at Ruby, and Ruby developers who need
  to deploy on Windows.
